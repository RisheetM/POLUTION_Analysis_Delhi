Questions:

Go to this link(https://wustl.app.box.com/v/ACAG-V5GL04-GWRPM25/folder/230741641760) and download the files for September, October, November, and December of 2022. Use Python libraries to perform the following tasks:
-Write a function to read the files and trim the files to Delhi’s latitude and longitude bounds (28 N, 29 N, 76.5 E, 77.75 E). Visualise the data from these files using Matplotlib. 
-Write a function that takes in several monthly files and computes the time-averaged value.
-Write a function to identify the location within Delhi’s bounds with the highest PM 2.5 value by month. 
-Create a Python Class with all the above functions. 

You can use either the NetCDF4 library or the Xarray library(preferred) in Python.

-Use the same link to download files corresponding to all the months in 2021. Compute the spatial average after trimming to Delhi’s latitude and longitude bounds by month. Plot the time series of the monthly spatial averages.   


NOTE:- Filepath of the files may be required to be changed as filepaths will vary as per your system
